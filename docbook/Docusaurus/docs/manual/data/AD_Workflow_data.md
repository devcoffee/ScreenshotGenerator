Another subject to take into account are the production cost and the capacity of shipping good quality products. Using Planning Management you answer the question: When and How Many products we must get?                                                                                                                                 |        true         | false  | false  |         0         |                       |      Planning Management Setup       |                          |     0      |                  |          R           |          1          |               |                       |         |                     |                             |              |            |      Setup Planning Management       |   0    |        0        |             G             |         0         |              |

With this information, we are able to balance the time demand with the available time. Through the knowledge of the required and available capacities it is possible to adjust the Master Production Schedule(MPS) until we arrive at a realistic one.                                                                                                                                                                   |        true         | false  |  true  |         0         |                       | Capacity Requirement Planning Setup  |                          |     0      |                  |          R           |          1          |               |                       |         |                     |                             |              |            | Setup Capacity Requirement Planning  |   0    |        0        |             G             |         0         |              |

Each time you need to release an order you need to be sure the components are complete in the warehouse, this is obtained by tracking the release and due dates for every component, this is easy to get using the shortages reports and from this module. This module mainly answer the question: What do I need to do to accomplish the MPS? If you cannot cover the MPS as you had planned, this module gives you information needed to decrease the effect on the costs and on the customer service.                                                              |        true         | false  | false  |         0         |                       |     Discrete Manufacturing Setup     |                          |     0      |                  |          R           |          1          |               |                       |         |                     |                             |              |            |     Setup Discrete Manufacturing     |   0    |        0        |             G             |         0         |              |

When you are setting up the system, you do it in reverse: First you define how you measure it and last you define the goals for the measurements. You have three ways measuring performance: - via quantifiable measures (e.g. sales of $3 million in Q1) - via manual measures - via achievements (tasks) The system converts the measures into percentages (based on the target and achieved measure - or number of total and reached achievements)                                                              |        false        | false  |  true  |                   |                       |    Performance Measurement Setup     |                          |            |                  |          U           |          1          |               |                       |         |                     |                             |              |            |    Setup Performance Measurement     |   1    |        0        |             G             |         0         |              |
